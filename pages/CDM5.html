  <h1>M5 - Statistics (Level C/D)</h1>

<table><tbody>
  <tr><td><b>Standard Area</b></td><td><b>Standard</b></td><td><b>Competence Area</b></td><td><b>Competence</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>M5 - Statistics</td><td>Find summary statistics of a data set, including the mean, median, mode and range, and determine how changes in the extreme values affect each of them</td><td>1 - Consumer Economics</td><td>Compute mileage and gasoline consumption</td></tr>
<tr><td>M5 - Statistics</td><td>Find all the possible outcomes (sample space) by systematically figuring the possible combinations and/or permutations of a number of elements in practical situations</td><td>6 - Math</td><td>Demonstrate general computation skills</td></tr>
<tr><td>M5 - Statistics</td><td>Identify possible outcomes involving compound events and determine the probability of their occurrence by considering whether the events are independent (e.g., rolling one die multiple times) or conditional (choosing 2 aces from a deck of cards)</td><td>6 - Math</td><td>Demonstrate general computation skills</td></tr>
<tr><td>M5 - Statistics</td><td>Compare different samples or groupings (e.g., age, gender) in a data set, or compare individual pieces of data to an overall set or average</td><td>4 - Employment</td><td>Interpret job-related signs, charts, diagrams, forms, and procedures, and record information on forms</td></tr>

<h1>Announcements</h1>
<br>
<p><b>11/2/21</b></p>
<p>Today's notes from the CASAS practice test (Essential Ed): <A HREF="links/Class 11-2.pdf">Problem 7, 16, and 17</A></p>
<p><b>11/1/21</b></p>
<ul>
   <li><p>Let me know in-person, by email, or by the live stream chat which CASAS level you will be retaking next (refer to your learning plan for this). I will then assign you a practice test on Essential Education (located under the assignments tab). Confirm that it is the correct level for you (A/B or C/D). Please email me if you have any issues accessing it, or you have already completed the practice test before.</p></li>
   <li><p>Remember to take notes and don't leave any questions blank. It is a timed assessment. You do not need to share your score/results with me, but instead they should be used as another guideline for which type of questions you need to review.</p></li>
   <li><p>After you are done, review the answers and explanations. Then email me your test level (A/B or C/D) and test number (1 or 2), as well as 2-4 problems you'd like to review. I will select the problems that the majority would like to review - this will be what we discuss in class on Tuesday and Thursday this week.</p></li>
</ul>
<br>
<p><b>10/25/21 - 10/28/21</b></p>
<p>Here are the notes from the in-class discussions that answer the <A HREF="links/Sample_Items.pdf">CASAS Sample Items</A> worksheet:</p>
<ul>
   <li><p><A HREF="links/CASAS1.pdf">Problem 1</A></p></li>
   <li><p><A HREF="links/CASAS23.pdf">Problem 2 and 3</A> </p></li>
   <li><p><A HREF="links/CASAS45.pdf">Problem 4 and 5</A> </p></li>
</ul>
<br>
<p><b>10/20/21 - 10/21/21</b></p>
<p>Read all instructions/announcements before beginning today's assignment.</p>
<p>At this point, you should have access to your DSC email, Essential Education, live stream link, and CASAS score reports. You should have also created your GED-prep learning plan using those reports and the LearnABE website (refer to the previous announcements for instructions to catch yourself up). Let me know if you have any questions about this.</p>
<ul>
   <li><p>It is important that you check your email regularly</p></li>
   <li><p>Essential Education is a supplemental online instructional program - you may work on this during or outside of class hourse at your own pace</p></li>
   <li><p>Keep track of your GED-prep learning plan, you will use this to stay on track and prepare for the CASAS re-assessment (or GED math test) at the end of the semester</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The worksheet below contains a few sample problems that I hope to help you be comfortable and confident in answering (as well as any variations of the problems). I do not expect you to know how to solve all of the problems - everyone is starting at a different level of understanding. However, I do expect you to attempt the problems today, to the best of your ability. Tomorrow, as a class discussion I will explain how I attempted to solve each problem, and if you'd like, you may share how you did too.</p>
<p>How I suggest that you approach solving the worksheet:</p>
<ul>
   <li><p>First, read through each problem, then click on the 'topics to review' and <b>take notes</b> while you do so</p></li>
   <li><p>If you feel like you need more suggestions for topics to review, let me know and I will come help</p></li>
   <li><p>Today's assignment is about finding and using the appropriate resources to help you with self-guided learning, but I am here for assistance with that, so please reach out if you are unsure about any part of today's announcements</p></li>

<p><b>Fall A Term </b>-------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p><b>10/11/21 - 10/14/21</b></p>
<p>This is the last week of the Fall A term - If you have met the required minimum hours to post-test, please contact me to set up a testing date. </p>
<p><b>10/4/21 - 10/7/21</b></p>
<p>How I recommend taking the practice test:</p>
<ul><li><p>Time yourself using your phone or the computer, but do not rush (this is only for reference, there is no time limit)</p></li>
   <li><p>First, complete all the questions you know how to do, skip those you are unsure about</p></li>
   <li><p>Then, go back and attempt those you weren't sure about</p></li>
   <li><p><b>Most importantly,</b> write out your work so that I can check it if you have questions afterwards</p></li>
</ul>
<p><p><A HREF="links/ABX_0100___Fall_2021_Practice_Test__AB_and_CD.pdf">CASAS Practice Test</A></p></p>
<p>When you are done, come see me or send me an email and I will send you the answer key.
<p><b>9/27/21 - 9/30/21</b></p>
<ul><li><p>This week, you created GED accounts to familiarize yourself with the content of the other subjects (Language Arts, Social Studies, and Science). Make sure the email you used to create your account is your DSC email. After you have reviewed the free study material and answered the practice questions, contact me if you would like help registering for the GED Ready Practice Test, which will tell you if you are ready to take the GED exam.</p></li>
<li><p>Please review the worksheets from this week and previous weeks. I encourage you to write an outline for working through the problems and start creating other examples to work through. If you need help getting started with that, please let me know!</p></li>

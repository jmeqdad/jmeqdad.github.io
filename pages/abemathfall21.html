<p>How I recommend taking the practice test:</p>
<ul><li><p>Time yourself using your phone or the computer, but do not rush (this is only for reference, there is no time limit)</p></li>
   <li><p>First, complete all the questions you know how to do, skip those you are unsure about</p></li>
   <li><p>Then, go back and attempt those you weren't sure about</p></li>
   <li><p><b>Most importantly,</b> write out your work so that I can check it if you have questions afterwards</p></li>
</ul>

<p>When you are done, come see me or send me an email and I will send you the answer key.
<p><b>9/27/21 - 9/30/21</b></p>
<ul><li><p>This week, you created GED accounts to familiarize yourself with the content of the other subjects (Language Arts, Social Studies, and Science). Make sure the email you used to create your account is your DSC email. After you have reviewed the free study material and answered the practice questions, contact me if you would like help registering for the GED Ready Practice Test, which will tell you if you are ready to take the GED exam.</p></li>
<li><p>Please review the worksheets from this week and previous weeks. I encourage you to write an outline for working through the problems and start creating other examples to work through. If you need help getting started with that, please let me know!</p></li>

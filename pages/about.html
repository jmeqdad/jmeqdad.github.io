<h1>Learn Adult Basic Education</h1>
<p>This website was created for those who are enrolled in an Adult Basic Education (ABE) program that uses the Comprehensive Adult Student Assessment System (CASAS) for course placement and monitoring student academic progress. The content is adapted from the <A HREF="https://www.casas.org/product-overviews/assessments/math-goals" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Math GOALS</A> assessment by CASAS. </p>
  <p>I personally recommend studying by the standard area, but the breakdown by question number is also provided. This information is publicly available on the CASAS website and has been reorganized on this site for clarity purposes only. This site is meant to be used as a guideline for students and teachers, and there is no guarantee that the information provided here will be exactly, or similar to, what you are tested on. If you find any errors, please contact me and I will update the website accordingly.</p>
